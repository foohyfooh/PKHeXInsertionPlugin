# PKHeX Insertion Plugin

The purpose of this [PKHeX](https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX) plugin is to insert an empty slot in your save file.

## Instructions
- Download the *InsertionPlugin.dll* from the latest release [here](https://github.com/foohyfooh/PKHeXInsertionPlugin/releases/latest).
- Unblock the *InsertionPlugin.dll* in Windows' Properties Menu.
- Put *InsertionPlugin.dll* in the *plugins* folder that is in the same directory as the PKHeX binary.
- *Insertion Plugin* should now be in the *Tools* menu of PKHeX.
- Input the Box Number and Slot Number and all the Pokémon from that spot will be moved down a single slot.

**Caution**: Currently if there is no space for shifting down then the last Pokémon will be erased.

*If you are confused on the setup then you can follow the instructions from PKHeX-Plugins [here](https://github.com/architdate/PKHeX-Plugins/wiki/Installing-PKHeX-Plugins).*
